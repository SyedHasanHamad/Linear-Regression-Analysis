Linear regression analysis is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationships 
between a response variable and one or more predictor variables. In this analysis, we delve into the world of linear regression to understand its application better. The primary focus of this study 
is to predict the percentage of body fat using Brozek's equation as the response variable. This 
equation is influenced by 17 potential predictor variables, which we will explore and leverage to 
build predictive models. To facilitate our analysis, we'll follow a structured approach that 
includes data splitting, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, testing error 
calculations, and the implementation of the Monte Carlo Cross-Validation method.
